;; URL: https://github.com/cyberthal/treefactor
;; Version: 3.2.0

;;; Commentary:

;; Treefactor provides commands to incrementally refile files in Dired and to
;; refactor outlines. It allows Org mode to manage a dynamic meta-outline
;; combining both the directory hierarchy and outlines within files.
