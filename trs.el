;;; Commentary:

;; Treesort rapidly sorts text and files into outlines and the directory tree.

;; Treesort's main command is trs-throw. It moves text or files from the current
;; window to a target in the next window. A second function, trs-throw-up, moves
;; text or files up one directory level. You can throw directories as well as
;; files.

;; When you throw a file to a directory, trs-throw creates a child directory
;; <target-directory>/0-Inbox/ and puts the file there. This makes it easy to
;; remember which files are new arrivals.

;; When you throw text to a directory, trs-throw creates a file Inbox.org. Many
;; such files are created during a filing session. To quickly delete them, use
;; trs-delete-this-buffer-and-file.

;; Treesort can rapidly change the directory tree structure of your notes. It
;; helps to have some links that won't break when paths change. Use
;; trs-dired-zinks to create a file with an org-id link in it.

;; trs-throw can throw text into existing files or outlines. You can duplicate a
;; heading to another text window with trs-duplicate-heading-to-other-window.

;; When you throw text to an outline, trs-throw believes that the parent heading
;; is at the top of the visible region. It will only throw to direct children of
;; the parent. You should narrow appropriately before throwing.

;; When you throw text to a file, trs-throw puts the text at the bottom. EXCEPT
;; when the file already has a level-1 heading. Then trs-throw assumes this is a
;; polished document, not an inbox file. trs-throw worries you will forget about
;; text appended to polished documents. So it prepends the text before the
;; level-1 headline, where it will stick out like a sore thumb.

;; trs-throw assumes that most headings you file will have four stars. Why?
;; Imagine you are throwing headings to an outline. The level-1 heading is the
;; document title. The level-2 headings are categories. The level-3 headings are
;; sub-categories. The level-4 headings are topics. Outlines become unwieldy
;; when they get too deep, at which point it's better to create more files and
;; directories to spread the load.

;; trs-throw only imposes this opinion on you in one way: it creates Inbox.org
;; files with a "*** offset" at the top. You can still file level-5 headings,
;; but they might "vanish" if you file a level-4 heading that unintentionally folds
;; appended level-5 headings beneath it. You can also file level-3 headings,
;; although they won't be children of the "offset" heading, and might
;; unexpectedly fold appended level-4 headings. I recommend that you convert
;; headings to level 4 for transport, and then resize them at their destination.

;; The last text thrown is saved in the variable trs-object-text until the Emacs
;; session ends. Text is not saved to the kill ring. A message appears in the
;; minibuffer displaying the destination of text and files moved with ts-throw
;; commands.

;;;; Installation

;;;;; MELPA

;; If you installed from MELPA, you're done. (This package is not yet on MELPA.)

;;;;; Manual

;; Put this file in your load-path, and put this in your init
;; file: trs.el

;; (require 'trs)

;;;; Usage

;; Run one of these commands:

;; `trs-throw' throw text/files to the next window
;; `trs-throw-up' throw text/files one directory up
;; `trs-delete-this-buffer-and-file' self-explanatory
;; `trs-store-link-fold-drawer' store an org link and hide the drawer
;; `trs-dired-zinks' store an org link in a file, titled with relative path
;; `trs-duplicate-heading-to-other-window' self-explanatory

;;;; Tips

;; Use org-id for global link IDs that are not path-dependent.

;; Treesort encourages many org files in deeply nested directories. This can
;; make it challenging to construct an org-agenda files list. See here to load
;; org agenda files recursively:
;; https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17215868/recursively-adding-org-files-in-a-top-level-directory-for-org-agenda-files-take

;; It also helps to have a function that refreshes your org agenda file list, if
;; you've altered paths in that directory.

;; I recommend configuring Dired to sort directories before files. Where
;; possible, capitalize files and directories. This makes it easy to target them
;; with isearch in a few keystrokes. Omit extensions to reduce visual clutter.

;; Treesort filing is fast. Think with your fingers, not your brain. You can
;; always redo it later.

;;; My keybindings

;; By putting the following commands on convenient keys, you can file without thinking about it.

;; (global-set-key (kbd "H-f") 'trs-throw)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "H-g") 'trs-throw-up)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-c k") 'trs-delete-this-buffer-and-file)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-c l") 'trs-store-link-fold-drawer)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "H-a") 'other-window)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "H-w") 'outline-up-heading)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "H-e") 'outline-previous-visible-heading)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "H-r") 'outline-next-visible-heading)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "H-d") 'org-narrow-to-subtree)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "H-s") 'widen)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "H-1") 'spacemacs/toggle-maximize-buffer)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "H-2") 'delete-window)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "H-3") 'split-window-right)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "s-i") 'ido-dired)

;;; Comments and whitespace

;; Treesort departs from
;; https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Coding-Conventions.html
;; by placing close-parentheses on lines by themselves where it enhances
;; readability. I find it much easier to keep track of parenthetical nesting
;; with indentation than only by counting and font color. Ruby does something
;; similar by placing end-braces on lines by themselves when they embrace
;; multiple lines.

;; Treesort uses an Outshine-style outline to structure its code. Outline
;; navigation, narrowing and folding negates the disadvantage of using extra
;; lines to show end-parentheses indentation. Outshine supports todo tags. There
;; are two level-1 headings at the beginning of the code due to Outshine's
;; visibility-cycling behavior.
